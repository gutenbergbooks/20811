    <p>This little volume now starts upon its way to visit the homes of those who, with
    us, desire above all things the overthrow of the liquor traffic. When it knocks at
    your door, kindly admit it and treat it as a welcome guest&mdash;a loved friend;
    remain blind to its faults, and see only the good intended.</p>
    <p>We send it forth, not for its literary merit, not for any honor to ourselves, but
    as a faithful record of the work accomplished by the Woman's Christian Temperance
    Union of the State of New York during the two decades just closed. It was written at
    your request, and it is yours, not ours. That it may be of benefit to the work and a
    pleasure to the workers is all we ask. We commend it to you with earnest prayers and
    best wishes.</p>

    istories are strange things: they uncover so many hidden events, and bring back so
    many lost memories. A history that traces the beginnings of a reform movement, that
    weaves the shuttle of memory in and out of the web of the past and presents a perfect
    woof of fact and incident, is a treasury of knowledge that will not fail to delight
    and instruct. But the compilation of such a history is no easy task, and especially
    is this true of an organization with the many ramifications of the Woman's Christian
    Temperance Union of the State of New York.</p>

    <p>The 14th of October, 1894, marked the twenty-first milestone in our history, and
    the story that follows is the story of the hopes and fears, the smiles and tears of
    the past twenty years, mingled with songs of rejoicing for grand achievement. For
    twenty years this organization has stood with undaunted front against the sin of the
    state as represented by the legalized traffic in intoxicating liquors and by the
    awful vice that would put a premium on woman's shame.</p>
    <p>During this time it has uttered its shibboleth that that political party, and that
    only, which declares in its platform for the complete prohibition of the liquor
    traffic, can have its influence and its prayers. There have been days of darkness and
    disaster, but by the grace of God no weapon turned against the union has prospered,
    and every tongue that has risen in judgment has been<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> condemned. The growth of the
    organization has been marvelous, for in twenty years it has grown from a few hundred
    members to twenty-two thousand, and from a few auxiliaries to over nine hundred,
    which cover as a network the entire state. Its workers are indefatigable, and wage
    their peaceful war for "sweeter manners, purer laws," with an earnestness that
    carries conviction to the hearts of the people and the law-makers of the state. And
    wherever there is a wrong to right, an evil to attack, or a hand to help, there will
    you find a woman with a white ribbon on her breast.</p>
    <p>The committee having this history in charge have searched faithfully the records
    of twenty years. Some of the names recorded here have never been heard by the workers
    of later years. Their owners have crossed the boundary-line that separates this world
    from the next. But living and dead speak with one voice of their love, service, and
    consecration to the work; and out of these God has welded a union that stands for all
    that is pure and good in government and the home, and whose work for Him and for
    humanity will never cease until</p>
    <center>
      <b>"All the bells of God shall ring the ship of Temperance in."</b>
    </center>
    <p>We feel that the state is under many obligations to Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Gardenier
    for so faithfully recording the work of these past years, for while in one sense it
    has been a labor of love, yet the many hours spent in earnest research for the
    necessary data must have been hours of toil. And while we thank our beloved sisters
    for their work and interest, our thoughts turn to the thousands of women whose lives
    have made this history possible&mdash;those who have gone steadfastly forward in the
    line of duty, thinking not of the world's applause, but doing all things and bearing
    all things in the Master's name and for the Master's sake.</p>
    <p>With this history we have reached our majority&mdash;twenty-one years. "Old enough
    to vote," I hear some one say. Yes, quite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13"
    id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> But the state, whose children we are marshaling under
    the total abstinence banner of the Loyal Temperance Legion; with whose vice and
    misery we are in a hand-to-hand conflict, and have done much to suppress; which has
    felt the influence of our work in hundreds of directions, and whose law-makers
    declare that it is good, and good only, has not yet awarded us the right. But long
    before we reach our second majority the piece of paper that "does the freeman's will
    as lightning does the will of God" will be placed in the hand of woman, and sin and
    impurity, like the shadows, will flee away.</p>
    <p>And for those who are still in the stress of the battle, for those who will come
    after us, and for those who will kindly read these pages, "May God bless us each and
    every one."</p>

    <h4>(<span class="smcap">Veteran Crusader</span>)</h4>
    <p>Esther Lord was born in Carlisle, Schoharie county, New York, in the year 1812.
    Her father was a Connecticut Yankee, her mother a native of Massachusetts. When
    Esther was ten years of age her father died, leaving ten children. We know little of
    the struggles through which they passed before reaching manhood and womanhood.</p>
    <p>In 1832 she was married to James McNeil, of Carlisle, and together they enlisted
    under the Washingtonian movement to fight the demon drink. About a month after her
    marriage she became a Christian, and, with a new heart, God gave her the desire to be
    of use to others, and she offered herself to the Lord to care for homeless children.
    Although she has never been blessed with children of her own, yet the mother heart
    has not been empty. In 1868 she with her husband moved to Fredonia, Chautauqua
    county, New York, with eight homeless children to be put to school. Two years later
    her husband, who was a member of the State Temperance Society, died, and in this same
    year one of her dear girls died.</p>
    <p>In 1873 she entered the list of crusaders, and became a member of the Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union, organized December 22, 1873. This union has continued to
    be the leading union in the county, holding weekly meetings, and loyal always to
    county, state, and national organizations. Mrs. McNeil was the first county
    president, and for the past seventeen years has been the local president in Fredonia.
    Although now past eighty-two years of age, yet at the twenty-first annual convention
    she led the "Crusaders' Hour" with great acceptance.</p>

    hen history shall have recorded the events of America's nineteenth century, prominent
    among them will be the "Woman's Crusade," a movement whose strength, please God, will
    not be spent until the last legalized saloon has disappeared from this fair
    land.</p>

    <p>Hillsboro, Ohio, claims the birthplace, and December 23, 1873, as the birthday of
    this momentous event. True, from this place and day the influence deepened and
    widened, spreading to other localities with wonderful rapidity; but to Fredonia,
    Chautauqua county, New York, is accorded the honor of inaugurating the work, December
    15, 1873. How was this brought about? The story in brief is this:</p>
    <p>On Saturday evening, December 13, Dr. Dio Lewis, of Boston, had delivered a
    popular lecture in Fredonia, and upon invitation of the Good Templars remained to
    deliver a temperance lecture at a union service Sunday night. The audience was large,
    but there was no indication of unusual results from the meeting. The speaker
    presented the truth so forcibly, and recommended plans of procedure so practical,
    that the audience caught his spirit. At the close of the lecture it was evident
    something was going to be done, and that right speedily. Dr. Lewis outlined a plan of
    work which he had seen tried with success in his own village when a youth, and later
    in other places. The thoughtful ones saw its feasibility, and numbers spoke upon the
    question. Rev. Lester Williams, pastor of the Baptist Church, said he<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> believed in
    striking while the iron was hot, and asked all the ladies who sympathized with the
    proposition to hold a meeting of consultation relative to the work to rise. Nearly
    every woman was upon her feet. A list of fifty names was secured of those who were
    ready to act, and a committee consisting of Mrs. A.L. Benton, Mrs. Dr. Fuller, and
    Mrs. J.P. Armstrong, Jr., was appointed to draw up an appeal to be presented to the
    various liquor dealers of the town.</p>
    <p>A meeting was called at the Baptist Church for Monday morning, December 15, at ten
    o'clock, to adopt the appeal and inaugurate the work. The past few days had been dark
    and gloomy, but Monday was bright and beautiful. Mr. Williams remarked that in it
    they could see the smile of God upon the movement. About three hundred people
    gathered at the appointed hour&mdash;men and women. The following appeal was
    submitted and adopted:</p>
    <center>
      APPEAL.
    </center>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>In the name of God and humanity we make our appeal:</p>
      <p>Knowing, as we do, that the sale of intoxicating liquors is the parent of every
      misery, prolific of all woe in this life and the next, potent alone in evil,
      blighting every fair hope, desolating families, the chief incentive to crime, we,
      the mothers, wives, and daughters, representing the moral and religious sentiment
      of our town, to save the loved members of our households from the temptation of
      strong drink, from acquiring an appetite for it, and to rescue, if possible, those
      that have already acquired it, earnestly request that you will pledge yourself to
      cease the traffic here in these drinks, forthwith and forever. We will also add the
      hope that you will abolish your gaming tables.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The women then retired to the room below, organized for work, and arranged a line
    of march. The men meanwhile prayed and planned, twenty-three of them pledging to pay
    the percentage of $1,000 placed opposite their names for carrying on the work.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
    <p>At half-past twelve o'clock the procession marched out of the basement of the
    Baptist Church, over one hundred being in line. These were the wives of Fredonia's
    most respected citizens, venerable and revered matrons, as well as many young women.
    Headed by Mrs. Judge Barker and Mrs. Rev. Lester Williams, they quietly walked across
    the park straight to the Taylor House saloon. The band of women filed in, nearly
    filling the place. Mrs. Barker immediately made known their mission. Mrs. Williams
    read to the proprietor the appeal. A hymn was sung to Pleyel's sweet air, and all
    joined in the Lord's prayer, after which Mrs. Tremaine, a venerable and gifted woman,
    offered a prayer full of Christian tenderness. Mr. Taylor was then asked if he would
    not accede to their appeal. He finally said, "If the rest will close their places,
    I'll close mine." His brother and partner did not consent so readily. The ladies
    asked him to consider the matter, promising to call the next day for his decision.
    The proprietor replied "That he would be pleased to see them every day," and politely
    bowed the ladies out. This visit was a sample of those made until every saloon,
    hotel, and drug store had been visited. This work was continued daily, and during the
    week union prayer-meetings were held every night. One drug store responded to the
    appeal; one hotel closed its bar; the visits became distasteful to one dealer, and he
    locked the women out.</p>
    <p>The <i>Fredonia Censor</i>, a weekly paper, in its issue of Wednesday, December
    17, 1873, contained the following headlines:</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>On Monday afternoon, December 21, the women met to perfect a permanent<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> organization, which
    they did by adopting the following pledge and name:</p>
    <center>
      PLEDGE.
    </center>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>We, the undersigned women of Fredonia, feeling that God has laid upon us a work
      to do for temperance, do hereby pledge ourselves to <i>united</i> and
      <i>continuous</i> effort to suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors in our
      village <i>until this work be accomplished</i>; and that we will stand ready for
      united effort upon any renewal of the traffic. We will also do what we can to
      alleviate the woes of drunkards' families, and to rescue from drunkenness those who
      are pursuing its ways.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>This society shall be known as <i>The Woman's Christian Temperance Union of
      Fredonia</i>.</p>

    <p>Two hundred and eight members were enrolled, sixty-four of whom were young women.
    The first officers were: Mrs. George Barker, President; Mrs. D. R. Barker,
    Vice-President; Mrs. L. A. Barmore, Secretary; Mrs. L. L. Riggs, Treasurer.</p>
    <p>Thus was the wonderful movement called "The Crusade" begun, and the first local
    Woman's Christian Temperance Union organized.</p>
    <p>That the local paper was keeping a keen watch on the movements of the women is
    evidenced by the following headlines in the <i>Censor</i> of December 24, 1873:</p>

    <p>t soon became apparent that the methods of the crusade could not be continued
    indefinitely; that in order to strengthen and perpetuate the work already begun
    organization was necessary. This sentiment prevailed in the State of New York, and
    many local societies, bearing various names, had already been formed.</p>
    <p>The initiatory for a state organization was taken by the Woman's Temperance Union
    of Syracuse, which, at a meeting held September 10, 1874, decided to call a state
    convention of all women's temperance organizations, to be held at Syracuse in
    October, preparatory to the great national convention which was to be held in
    November. A central committee of five was appointed to make all necessary
    arrangements, and on September 19th was issued the following:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <center>
        CALL.
      </center>
      <p>The Syracuse Woman's Temperance Union respectfully invite the working temperance
      women throughout the state to meet in convention in this city on the 14th day of
      October, at nine o'clock A. M., at the First Methodist Church, for the purpose of
      organizing a state temperance league, and to appoint delegates to the national
      convention to be held in Cleveland, Ohio, November next. <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
      <p>It is hoped that every town and city in the state will be represented. All
      newspapers are requested to give the above an insertion and a local notice, and all
      ministers are desired to read it from their desks.</p>
      <p>Delegates are requested to notify the secretary of their intention to be present
      by the both of October, and places of entertainment will be provided. A committee
      of reception will be in waiting at the rooms of the Young Men's Christian
      Association, 16 South Salina street, on Tuesday evening, and at the church on
      Wednesday morning.</p>

    <p>Pursuant to the above call, at nine o'clock A.M. of October 14, 1874, a large
    gathering of earnest women from various parts of the state assembled at the First
    Methodist Episcopal Church of Syracuse, for the purpose of discussing the great
    interests of the temperance cause and plan for its future advancement.</p>
    <p>The meeting was called to order by Mrs. Allen Butler, of Syracuse, who was made
    temporary chairman, with Mrs. S. Thurber and Miss A.L. Didama as secretaries.</p>
    <p>The permanent organization was perfected by the election of the following

    <p>Of this number thirteen were present at the twentieth convention, held at Syracuse
    in 1893; among them being the first chairman, Mrs. Butler; the first secretary, Mrs.
    N.B. Foot; and Mrs. Esther McNeil, our venerable crusader, of Fredonia.</p>
    <p>The keynote for the future was struck at the first convention, as will be seen in
    the report of the committee appointed to recommend topics for discussion. These
    represented the foundation principles of the organization, and were as follows:</p>
    <h4>TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION.</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>How should holly-tree inns or coffee-rooms be managed? What is their
      history?</p>
      <p>Is it a part of woman's work in the temperance cause to attend to the enforcing
      of the license laws?</p>
      <p>How can we arouse the young women to <i>think</i> as they never have upon this
      subject, and to realize that there is a practical obligation resting upon them?</p>
      <p>How can we make professing Christians feel their responsibilities?</p>
      <p>What is the most judicious way of awakening the clergy to more zealous effort in
      the cause of temperance, and securing the cooperation of the church as a body?</p>
      <p>How can we work most effectually among the children?</p>
      <p>Can domestic wines be made and used consistently by Christian women, or with
      safety to their families? Is it not encouraging intemperance?</p>
      <p>Can we, as temperance women, use wine and cider for culinary purposes with
      consistency or safety?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Pending these discussions a constitution was drafted. This was adopted,<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> and a state society
    called "The Christian Woman's State League" was formed.</p>
    <p>The following officers were elected for the first year:</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>President</i>&mdash;Mrs. Allen Butler,
    Syracuse.</span></p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Vice-Presidents</i>&mdash;Mrs. Mary C. Johnson,
    Brooklyn; Mrs. Helen E. Brown, New York; Mrs. Dr. Kenyon,</span><br /><span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">
    Buffalo; Mrs. L. B. Ayers, Penn Yan; Mrs. B. F. Hall, Auburn.</span></p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Corresponding Secretary</i>&mdash;Mrs. Dr.
    Greeley, Syracuse.</span></p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Recording Secretary</i>&mdash;Mrs. Mary T.
    Burt, Auburn.</span></p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Treasurer</i>&mdash;Mrs. T. S. Truair,
    Syracuse.</span></p>
    <p>During the first year two quarterly meetings were held&mdash;one at Brooklyn in
    February, and one at Buffalo in May. At the Brooklyn meeting the constitution was
    somewhat modified, and the name changed to the present one&mdash;"The Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union of the State of New York."</p>
    <p>The first legislative work of the society was the memorializing of President Grant
    and Governor Dix. This memorial was prepared by Mrs. B. C. Rude, of Wellsville, Miss
    M. E. Armstrong, of Fayetteville, and Mrs. M. B. O'Donnell, of Lowville.</p>
    <h5>FIRST MEMORIAL.</h5>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>We, temperance women of the State of New York, in convention at Syracuse, deeply
      sensible that intemperance is a prevailing and corrupting power for evil, affecting
      the happiness and well-being of multitudes of all classes and conditions impotent
      to protect themselves from its influences, but citizens, all claiming the natural
      and lawful protection of our rulers and executors of our laws; that its pernicious
      influence in the home, by subverting every principle of right, is in the aggregate
      corrupting the entire national body, subverting the intent of our political
      institutions; and whereas petitioning is our only resort, we have petitioned our
      God, the Infinite Ruler, in your behalf, and now petition your excellency, in
      behalf of the temperance cause, that you appoint to positions in the civil
      service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> none
      but total abstinence men. All of which we most respectfully submit, and for which
      your petitioners will ever pray.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The memorial to Governor Dix was presented directly by the State League; that to
    President Grant was referred to the national society soon to be formed.</p>
    <p>Twenty-two delegates were appointed to attend the convention called at Cleveland,
    Ohio, November 18, 19, and 20, 1874, for the purpose of organizing a national
    society. The State of New York was honored in this convention by the appointment of
    Mrs. Mary T. Burt as secretary of the organizing convention, and by the election of
    Mrs. Mary C. Johnson as recording secretary, and Mrs. Dr. Kenyon as one of the
    vice-presidents for the first year.</p>
    <p>The following resolutions were adopted at the first meeting, and must have been
    drafted with a prophet's ken, as they have been largely fulfilled in the years that
    have passed:</p>
    <h5>RESOLUTIONS.</h5>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>WHEREAS, Intemperance has become so widespread, permeating every class and
      condition of society, even from the sacred desk to the hovel, we hail with
      gratitude to God the many indications of the revival in the interest of temperance
      reform which exists in various portions of our country, and especially do we
      rejoice that the women have been awakened to the vast evils thereby entailed; and,
      relying upon divine guidance and support, we feel that the present time is
      particularly auspicious for that renewal and vigorous action on the part of friends
      of temperance which the exigencies of all so urgently demand; therefore,</p>
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That we, the temperance women of the State of New York, do
      organize a state temperance league, in the belief that we can the better aid,
      encourage, and fortify each other in the suppression of this growing vice, and in
      the creation of a universal and moral sentiment for temperance and sobriety; and to
      this end there should be much earnest prayer for God's wisdom to direct, His power
      to insure success, linked with persistent personal effort.</p>
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That it is our duty and privilege to stand firm in our<span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> example of total
      abstinence by abandoning the use of all intoxicants from our tables and from every
      department of domestic life.</p>
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That, in the judgment of this convention, one of the great
      hopes of the ultimate triumph of the temperance reform lies in a thorough training
      of the youth of the land in such principles and practices of temperance as will
      show them the fatal danger of drinking and the criminality of selling liquors; and
      we earnestly entreat the friends of the cause, and especially pastors of churches
      and superintendents of Sunday-schools throughout the state, to take immediate
      measures in their respective cities and towns for the formation in perpetual
      continuance of temperance societies to be composed of youths.</p>
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That the educational authorities of the state be and are hereby
      respectfully and earnestly requested to cause to be introduced, as soon as
      practicable, into all schools, text-books treating of the nature of intoxicating
      liquors and of the effects upon the human constitution, and that Sunday-schools
      introduce into their libraries literature inculcating positive principles which
      will develop wholesome temperance sentiment.</p>
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That we earnestly ask all good men to cooperate with us in our
      labor, and also by their votes to complete the work to which all our energies and
      our prayers are consecrated.</p>
      <p>For the accomplishment of these objects we shall religiously employ all the
      means God has placed within our reach, and constantly invoke His aid and
      guidance.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This first convention was marked by deep spiritual power. No step was taken
    without the manifest guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p>The sweet gale, or Dutch myrtle, grows in moorland fens. It is a humble plant, but
    <i>fragrant</i>; where it grows abundantly the miasma of the bog is neutralized by
    its balsamic odors and antiseptic qualities, disease is displaced and health
    established. So the sweet fragrance of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of the
    State of New York, planted at Syracuse, has been carried by prayer and faith to all
    New York, "giving beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of
    praise for the spirit of heaviness."</p>

    educational advantages were those offered by the public schools of her native county.
    Having decided musical tastes she improved the opportunities offered at the city of
    Albany for their cultivation, early dedicating her gift of song to the causes she
    loved. She became a Christian when thirteen years old, and by a long and useful
    Christian life has adorned her profession. In 1841 she was united in marriage with
    Allen Butler, and soon after removed to Syracuse, then a village of about six
    thousand inhabitants. During her life of more than half a century in Syracuse she has
    been identified with many of the Christian and benevolent institutions of the city,
    as well as those of her own church, to which she is devotedly attached.</p>
    <p>Frail in health, her interest in a cause often exceeded the strength to work for
    it. This was the apparent condition of things when the crusade with whirlwind power
    swept over the land. A life-long advocate of total abstinence, her interest in the
    cause could not be restrained, and gently her Heavenly Father led her in this work,
    first to a little gathering of temperance women, at which, after much importunity,
    she conducted the exercises. Some months later she became the chosen leader of these
    women. It was from this consecrated band, over the signature of Mrs. Butler with
    others, that the call for the first state convention of temperance women was
    made.</p>
    <p>Who more appropriately than she could call that convention to order? And when the
    State League, afterwards the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, was organized, it
    was no surprise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
    28]</a></span> that Mrs. Allen Butler was elected president, a position she retained
    for five years. These were years of anxiety but of great advancement in temperance.
    This was due not only to her thorough consecration and marked executive ability, but
    to a life-long experience in other public enterprises, all of which she brought to
    the temperance work.</p>
    <p>She was present at Cleveland and assisted in organizing the National Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union. Through feebleness of body she has been laid aside from
    active public work, but always as a member of a local union has felt the heartbeat of
    the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of New York State. At the "home-coming" in
    Syracuse in 1893, to celebrate our twentieth anniversary, Mrs. Butler was present. A
    Chautauqua salute greeted her upon presentation. After looking over the large
    gathering she solemnly said, "What hath God wrought?"</p>

    <h4>CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS, WITH CHANGES.</h4>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
      <img src="images/t.jpg" width="80" height="100" alt="t" title="" />

    he first constitution was adopted at Syracuse in October, 1874, but was somewhat
    modified at the meeting held at Brooklyn in February, 1875, when the name was changed
    from the "Christian Woman's State League" to "Woman's Christian Temperance Union of
    the State of New York."</p>
    <p>The first constitution provided for four general officers, five vice-presidents,
    and an executive committee of seven, all of whom were to be elected in such manner as
    might be determined from time to time. A financial basis was established at this time
    by fixing the auxiliary fee at twenty-five cents.</p>
    <p>In 1878 a constitutional change was made reducing the number of vice-presidents to
    three, and making the four general officers and three others elected for that
    especial purpose the executive committee, these to be nominated in open convention
    and elected by ballot. The terms of auxiliaryship were changed from the twenty-five
    cent per member basis to that of voluntary contributions to the state treasury by the
    local unions.</p>
    <p>In 1881 the electing of vice-presidents was discontinued, the presidents of
    organized counties being made <i>ex-officio</i> vice-presidents of the state union.
    The basis of representation was fixed at two delegates for each local union. The
    financial basis of twenty-five cents per member was again established.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> In 1882 the
    auxiliary fee was unfortunately reduced to twenty cents per member, which has greatly
    crippled the work since that time.</p>
    <p>In 1883 a radical change was made in the formation of the executive committee.
    Since 1878 it had been composed of the four general officers and three others elected
    by the convention. In this year the executive committee was made to consist of the
    four general officers and the presidents of county unions, who were <i>ex-officio</i>
    vice-presidents of the state union.</p>
    <p>In 1885 the constitution was thoroughly revised. A first vice-president was added
    to the general officers, and the time for the annual convention was fixed for the
    last week of September or the first week of October. The manner of election was also
    changed, the nominations being made by informal ballot. The basis of representation
    to the state convention was changed as follows One delegate for every local union
    having fifty or less than fifty paying members, and one for every additional fifty
    members. The time for election of officers was fixed for the morning of the last day
    of the convention. A life membership fee of twenty-five dollars and an honorary
    membership fee of five dollars annually were established, and have added greatly to
    the financial prosperity of the work. A clause requiring a year's notice of proposed
    change to the constitution was introduced.</p>
    <p>The society was incorporated in 1876 under the first order of electing the
    executive committee. As this method had been changed, in order to be legally
    entrenched for business purposes, in 1892 a change was made in the constitution,
    making the five general officers the managers or trustees, in harmony with the
    society's articles of incorporation. A basis of representation at the state
    convention and auxiliaryship for the Loyal Temperance Legion was also established,
    viz: "One delegate for every thousand members of the Loyal Temperance Legion, such
    dele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>gates to
    be chosen from the superintendents of the Loyal Temperance Legion, and to be an adult
    member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. The basis of this representation
    shall be the payment into the state treasury of one cent for every member of the
    legion."</p>
    <p>In 1893 the last change was made, which resumed the auxiliary fee of twenty-five
    cents per member, as established in the first constitution, as the basis of
    representation.</p>

    HIBBARD.</h2>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
    <h4>(SECOND PRESIDENT)</h4>
    <p>Maria Hyde was born in Oxford, Chenango County, New York, and was educated at the
    Oxford Academy, now the oldest incorporated academy in this state, having in June
    last celebrated its centennial. Born and reared in an eminently high spiritual and
    intellectual atmosphere, she was well qualified for the positions which she filled so
    acceptably. She was preceptress in the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, at Lima, New York,
    associate principal of the Seneca Collegiate Institute, also of the Binghamton
    Academy, and was afterward preceptress of Oxford Academy until her marriage with Rev.
    F.G. Hibbard, D.D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Hibbard was elected president of the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union
    at Poughkeepsie in 1879, which office she filled for three years, serving most
    faithfully and laying down the work only because of the press of home duties. These
    years were years of peace and harmony, and in giving of self to the cause she was
    also receiving a blessedness in return. It was during these busy years that she
    organized temperance work among the Indians on the reservation in Western New York.
    She has many gifts and graces, and has kept even pace with her husband (who is the
    author of several theological works of standing authority) in both literary and
    spiritual attainments, and "her gifts make room for her." She has been obliged to lay
    aside all public work and devote herself to caring for her husband, whose ill health
    demands most of her time, but she still gives her sympathies and her prayers to and
    for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union&mdash;the workers and the work.</p>

    t the first annual meeting, held at Ilion, a committee on organization of state was
    appointed, consisting of Mrs. Dr. Kenyon, of Buffalo; Mrs. Dr. Clary, of Auburn; Mrs.
    O'Donnell, of Lowville; Mrs. Truair and Miss Noble, of Syracuse. This committee
    formed plans, and organizers were appointed. Miss Elizabeth Greenwood, of Brooklyn,
    was the first one who reported work done.</p>
    <p>At this time those who did organizing work were called state agents. Miss
    Greenwood, in her first report, suggested the change from state agent to state
    organizer, which suggestion was acted upon and the name changed.</p>
    <p>For the first few years organization was effected by congressional districts, but
    later on this was changed to organization by counties, and has remained so up to the
    present time.</p>
    <p>Department work was first taken up in 1878, six departments being considered.
    Those having the work in charge were known as chairmen of standing committees. In
    1880 this was changed to the present name&mdash;superintendent of department.</p>
    <p>In 1882 the manner of representation to the national convention was changed from
    congressional districts to grouping of counties.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
    <p>For a number of years organization was made the leading line of work, and in 1888
    only three counties remained unorganized. Many of our county workers did valiant
    service in the line of organizing in their own localities, but the grand result
    reached in this year was due largely to the untiring energy and activity of our state
    organizers. Mrs. Burt, in her annual address for 1888, refers to their work in the
    following glowing words of commendation:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>But if our state excels, as I believe it does, in organization, it is largely
      due to the fact that our organizers are beyond comparison. Where will you find
      another Helen L. Bullock, or an E. M. J. Decker, or a Vandelia Varnum, or a Cynthia
      Jump, or Augusta Goodale, or such a list of county presidents, whom the record
      shows have made organizing their "chief concern" during the past twelve months? New
      York points with pride to these her daughters. They have not stopped to reason why,
      they have not stopped to make reply, but with a courage born of their high calling
      have gone steadfastly forward, and in many instances have snatched the palm of
      victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
    </div>
    <p>While paying this tribute to our organizers we do not forget her who stood at the
    head of our state work during these years, planning, directing, counseling, and
    encouraging. In Mary T. Burt we have a living embodiment of "there's no such word as
    fail." For twelve years she has led the white ribbon host of the Empire State, and if
    she can point with pride to these her co-workers, saying, "Where will you find their
    equal?" we can point with pride to our state president, and say, Where will you find
    <i>her</i> equal? Self has been forgotten, and with a courage born of her convictions
    she has grandly carried forward the work, standing always for the best interests of
    the state. And what is the result? In this year of 1894 there is not a county in our
    state, except one,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but what has a branch of the Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union within its borders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35"
    id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
    <p>Owing to various circumstances and conditions, the work in one or two counties has
    at different periods been suspended for a short time, usually to be taken up again
    with renewed vigor. Our total membership is more than twenty-two thousand, with an
    honorary membership of nearly five thousand.</p>
    <p>In 1881 annual blanks were sent out for the first time, thus making it easier to
    secure correct reports of membership and of work done.</p>
    <p>At the first annual meeting a form of pledge was appended to the constitution
    recommended for local societies, which read as follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>We, the undersigned women of &mdash;&mdash;, severally pledge ourselves in
      integrity and honor before God to abstain from the use of and from traffic in all
      intoxicating liquors as a beverage, and that we will not offer the same to others
      to be so used. And we further solemnly covenant before God henceforth to work and
      pray for the suppression of intemperance as a sin against God and man, and that in
      our work we will use such means and forward such measures as God shall direct
      through the Holy Spirit in answer to our prayer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This form was used for a few years only, and in 1878 we find it changed to the
    following:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>I hereby solemnly promise, God helping me, to abstain from all distilled,
      fermented, and malt liquors, including wine and cider, as a beverage, and to employ
      all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in the same.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1879 the words "as a beverage" were omitted, and the above pledge, with this
    change, is the one which is recommended to all local unions, and has stood so from
    1879 until the present day.</p>

      <b>MOTTO: "Tremble, King Alcohol! We shall grow up."</b>
    </center><br />
    <p>At the first meeting of the "State League," in 1874, one of the topics for
    discussion was, "How can we work most effectually among the children?" showing that
    in the very beginning they realized the fact that the hope of our final victory rests
    in the children, and the unions were urged to organize juvenile unions and Bands of
    Hope. The following year an interesting paper on juvenile work was read by Mrs.
    Bingham, of Rome, and a resolution adopted, which read:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That we urge upon our Sabbath-school superintendents the
      necessity of forming temperance organizations in every Sabbath-school, that the
      children be early pledged to total abstinence.</p>
    </div>
    <p>A form of constitution and by-laws for juvenile societies was recommended at this
    time, such society to be auxiliary to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. A form
    of pledge was also recommended, as follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>We, the undersigned children and youth of &mdash;&mdash;, having been instructed
      that the continued use of intoxicating liquors injures the body and endangers the
      soul, believe that it is safest for us never to begin. We do therefore solemnly
      promise never to use or traffic in any whiskey, brandy, wine, beer, ale, or
      anything that can intoxicate, as a beverage, nor encourage others to do so; and we
      will not use it as a medicine, unless prescribed by our parents or our physician.
      May God help us to keep our pledge.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The pledge of to-day is the triple pledge against alcohol, tobacco, and profanity,
    and even as early as 1875 we find a mention of this pledge as the one used by the
    children's society of Ilion, which then numbered two hundred members. In 1875
    Syracuse had a juvenile society called Cold Water Templars, which had two thousand
    members, and Brooklyn reported a Band of Hope with one thousand children
    pledged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
    <p>Carrying out the spirit of the suggestions and recommendations, children were
    organized under various names&mdash;Band of Hope, Band of Blue, Cold Water Temple,
    Juvenile Union, etc.,&mdash;and the work has been kept to the front during all these
    years, until now all juvenile societies connected with the Woman's Christian
    Temperance Union are marching under one name&mdash;the Loyal Temperance Legion.</p>
    <p>In 1891 the president in her annual address referred to "that splendid child of
    ours, the Loyal Temperance Legion," and suggested a plan whereby it might become
    auxiliary to the state, thereby giving to the children a feeling of helpfulness and
    cooperation, and to the state an inspiration which the representatives of twenty-five
    thousand children would be sure to give.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this suggestion, originally made by Mrs. Helen Rice, national
    superintendent, and Mrs. Harriet A. Metcalf, state superintendent, an organization
    was formed and called State Loyal Temperance Legion. This is composed of three
    hundred and eighty-eight companies. The year 1893 marks an era in Loyal Temperance
    Legion work, this being the year in which they began paying dues to the State Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union, thereby being entitled to their own delegate to the state
    convention.</p>
    <p>The juvenile work of our state has received the very best thought of those having
    it in charge. It was taken up as a department first in 1880, with Mrs. Frances D.
    Hall, of Plattsburg, as superintendent. In 1881 Mrs. Dr. Foster, of Clifton Springs,
    was appointed, each of these serving one year. In 1882 and 1883 Mrs. H. A. Perrigo,
    of Brockport, was the superintendent, and she was succeeded by Mrs. Jennie M.
    Pierson, of Auburn, who held the office for two years. In 1886 Mrs. Perrigo was again
    appointed, and she has been the superintendent from that time until now, with just a
    change of name from Perrigo to Met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38"
    id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>calf. Two annual meetings have been held since the
    organization of a State Loyal Temperance Legion&mdash;one at Syracuse and one at
    Cortland. That the children might be rooted and grounded in the total abstinence
    faith, a thorough course of study in the Lesson Manuals was prepared, and a plan
    evolved by which members of the legions who passed the examinations should receive
    diplomas. One hundred and forty have graduated and thirty-eight have won seals.</p>

    </div>
    <p>As an answer to the question asked at the meeting of 1874, "How can we arouse the
    young women to <i>think</i> as they never have upon this subject?" Miss Willard was
    secured to address the young women at the following convention, held at Ilion, and so
    marked was the effect upon her hearers that a Young Ladies' Temperance Union was
    organized that afternoon, with Miss Jessie Remington, of Ilion, as president.</p>
    <p>In 1879 a standing committee for "Young Ladies' Societies" was appointed, with
    Mrs. Frances Barnes as chairman. In 1880 this was changed to a department, and Mrs.
    S. R. Gray, of Albany, made the superintendent. In 1882 Miss Mary McClees was made
    superintendent of this line of work. In 1884 kitchen garden work was added, Miss
    Emilie Underhill having charge of the department. During her years of service we find
    an addition to her name, that of Burgess having been added, and as Emilie Underhill
    Burgess she continued as superintendent of the depart<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ment until the convention of 1887,
    kitchen garden work being dropped in the meantime.</p>
    <p>She was succeeded by Mrs. C.J.A. Jump, of Albany, who holds the position at this
    time. The work accomplished by this "faithful few" cannot be estimated, for who can
    measure the influence of the young women who during all these years have been
    learning the lessons which should fit them for better service in the Master's
    vineyard, and who during these years have answered for themselves the question which
    opens this department of organization work?</p>
    <p>In 1892 a change was made, taking this from the regular department work and making
    it the Young Woman's Branch, with Mrs. Jump as secretary, and about fifteen hundred
    young women in our state march under our white banner and demand "a white life for
    two."</p>

    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
    <h4>(OUR PRESIDENT)</h4>
    <p>Mrs. Mary Towne Burt, the third president of the New York State Woman's Christian
    Temperance Union, has occupied that position now for twelve years. If antecedents and
    previous faithful service are any indication of desert, then indeed she "came to the
    kingdom" worthily, and we need not wonder that she holds her place easily, nor that
    the work flourishes abundantly under her administration. Gifted with a fine presence,
    a pleasing address, and a well-balanced judgment, she is a fitting leader for the
    largest state delegation in the national convention. It is equally a pleasure to see
    her preside over our state convention of capable women, which often outnumbers the
    national organization, if it does not have so wide-reaching an influence. Her ability
    as a presiding officer has often been complimented by competent judges, and a quiet
    confidence in the fairness and impartiality of her rulings pervades the atmosphere of
    the assemblage and greatly aids the transaction of business, while many a pleasant
    little episode is graciously received and made to facilitate the progress of the
    programme.</p>
    <p>Born of English parentage in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, she was at the tender
    age of four years bereft of the care of a cultured father, who had been educated for
    the clerical ranks of the Church of England. Her mother, with whom she had a rare
    sympathy, was spared to an advanced age to encourage every good work by her sympathy
    and prayers. Her youth was spent in Auburn, New York, where she received rare
    educational advantages at Brown's Institute, and where in 1865 she was married to
    Edward Burt, of one of the oldest families in the state.</p>

    accordance with her own convictions and her mother's faithful teachings. She gave a
    public address in the opera house at Auburn, and served for two years as the first
    president of the local union in that place, and at the first meeting of the national
    union, at Cleveland, she was one of the secretaries. In 1875 she was first the
    publisher and then the managing editor of the national paper, <i>Our Union</i>, her
    home at this time being in Brooklyn. From 1878 to 1880 she was corresponding
    secretary of the national union, with her office in the Bible House, New York
    City.</p>
    <p>She has been identified with the New York State union since its inception. As its
    recording secretary for the first seven years of its existence, she had much to do
    with shaping its aims and its policy. After serving one year as corresponding
    secretary, she was elected president in 1882, at the convention in Oswego. At that
    time the state union had a membership of about three thousand, with but thirteen of
    the sixty counties organized. During the years of her presidency all the remaining
    counties but one have been organized, and the membership has gone up to twenty-two
    thousand. In her first annual address she recommended a change in the form of the
    executive committee, substituting for the three previously elected by ballot, in
    addition to the general officers, the vice-presidents of the state, who were the
    presidents of the county unions. This changed the possible numbers of the executive
    committee from seven to sixty-four. Other measures recommended by her have been the
    publication of a state paper, the opening of state headquarters in New York City,
    securing permanent headquarters, putting up a building on the permanent state fair
    grounds at Syracuse, creating the departments of Non-Alcoholics in Medicine and
    Rescue Work for Girls, the memorializing of the Democratic and Republican
    parties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> in
    behalf of prohibition and for the enfranchisement of woman, and petitioning the
    constitutional convention of 1894 for the last two purposes.</p>
    <p>For some years she has had charge of the legislative interests. In 1885-87 she was
    superintendent of the Department of Social Purity, and at once entered upon a
    vigorous campaign to raise "the age of consent" for young girls. In 1887 this effort
    was successful, the legislature raising the age from ten years to sixteen years. In
    1891-92 she led in the legislative work that resulted in the closing of the New York
    State exhibit at the World's Fair on the Sabbath, and in the passage of the bill
    prohibiting the employment of barmaids in saloons. She also led in the protest
    against the excise bill which resulted in the modification of some of its worst
    features, and in the protest against the infamous bill to legalize the social evil,
    preventing its introduction into the legislature.</p>
    <p>As an organizer she has been indefatigable. "Heat, cold, and wet and dry" were all
    equally braved by her in the task of meeting the women of many a locality and
    explaining the methods of this beneficent work, while her discriminating eye quickly
    selected those best fitted to lead off to success. On all occasions she has fostered
    a love for sincere temperance work, which has been of the greatest advantage to the
    stability and straightforwardness of the organization in all parts of the state. She
    has presided at the organization of a large proportion of the county unions. The
    personal acquaintance with the active members thus gained has greatly aided her in
    the selection of superintendents and committees, so far as it falls to the lot of the
    president to make such selections.</p>
    <p>In other enterprises she has shown similar ability. The erection of a permanent
    building on the state fair grounds at Syracuse is eminently suitable, in view of the
    fact that the Woman's Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
    id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Temperance Union had secured the passage in the state
    legislature of a law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors on the state and
    county fair grounds within its jurisdiction, the carrying out of which policy has
    totally changed the character and conduct of agricultural fairs in the Empire State.
    For several years Mrs. Burt has taken an active interest in the Woman's Christian
    Temperance Union work at the state fair grounds at Syracuse, greatly to the detriment
    of her health by overtaxing her physical strength. This course certainly gives the
    workers an inspiration to undertakings they would never think of braving but for the
    courage of their leader.</p>
    <p>Of a similar character were the skill and dash that secured the Metropolitan Opera
    House for the meeting of the national convention in 1888. It was said that "the women
    did it," but it was done so quietly and literally by such rising betimes in the
    morning that very few know that the skillful marshaling of the few available forces
    would after all have ended in failure had it not been for the quick wit and personal
    responsibility of the head hostess of the occasion, the president of the New York
    State Union.</p>
    <p>For thirteen years Mrs. Burt served the state without salary, giving to its work
    the best her life afforded freely and without price. With such leaders, under God,
    and with the true end kept steadily in view, Christian women ought not to fail in
    their great temperance work. It matters comparatively little with what branch of the
    evangelical church they are associated, but we are persuaded that none of us will
    esteem our president less when knowing that she has grown in trust and devoutness in
    this work while in the communion of the Protestant Episcopal Church.</p>

    he educational work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has been one of its
    prominent sources of usefulness. The trend of so many departments has been along this
    line, that to enter into the details of each would exceed the limit of this
    historical record.</p>
    <center>
    <b>"Teach it to thy children."</b>
    </center>
    <p>In a memorial presented to the state legislature in 1877 appeared a clause asking
    that it be made obligatory by law for all teachers to instruct their pupils in
    temperance. This was the inception of the Scientific Temperance Instruction
    Department of the New York State Woman's Christian Temperance Union.</p>
    <p>This was made a regular department of work in 1880, with Mrs. Mary T. Burt as
    superintendent. Mrs. E. H. Griffith, of Fairport, succeeded her the following year
    and laid some foundation for the work. Miss Elizabeth W. Greenwood, of Brooklyn, then
    became superintendent, continuing as such from 1882 to 1886, and to her must be
    accorded the honor of doing the <i>hard work</i> of the department. Her preliminary
    work consisted in visiting and presenting the subject before the various normal
    schools of the state. This aroused public interest and created a sentiment which made
    the subsequent work comparatively easy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45"
    id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> At the convention held at Poughkeepsie in 1883 it was
    decided to make the securing of a scientific temperance instruction law a leading
    line of work for the ensuing year, and Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, of Boston, national
    superintendent, was invited to assist the state superintendent in the campaign.</p>
    <p>This was faithfully done. And what of the result? In spite of opposition and
    discouragement, after six months of unparalleled labor came the greatest temperance
    victory the state had ever gained&mdash;the passage of the scientific temperance
    education law. The money for carrying on this expensive campaign was secured largely
    through the personal solicitation of Miss Greenwood and the secretary of the
    department, Mrs. C.C. Alford, of Brooklyn.</p>
    <p>After this law was enacted the state superintendent of public instruction delayed
    the introduction of new text-books (which, if introduced, must remain five years)
    until the books then under revision, and to be endorsed by the Woman's Christian
    Temperance Union, were ready. The first books introduced were Professor Steele's
    "Hygiene and Physiology," Mrs. Hunt's "Hygiene for Young People," and the "Child's
    Health Primer." Mrs. G.M. Gardenier, of Oswego, gave the first public scientific
    temperance lesson after the passage of the law at Round Lake, July 5, 1884; subject,
    "Alcohol and the Brain." This was during a series of meetings held under the auspices
    of the state organization.</p>
    <p>In 1886 Mrs. Marion S. Tifft, of Pine Valley, succeeded Miss Greenwood, serving
    two years. In 1889 Mrs. Lytie Perkins Davies was made superintendent, faithfully
    performing the duties and advancing the work until 1894.</p>
    <p>In 1888 "Higher Education" was made a department of work, Mrs. Anna E. Rice and
    Miss Julia E. Dailey each serving one year as superintendent, when the department was
    merged with that of Scientific Temperance Instruction.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> "Commission of Inquiry and Statistics
    of the Liquor Traffic" was made a department of state work in 1880, and continued
    until 1887. It had three superintendents&mdash;Mrs. Horace Eaton, of Palmyra, who
    served one year; Mrs. A. G. Nichols, of Kingston, was her successor, serving two
    years; and Mrs. A. T. Stewart, of Peekskill, who retained the superintendency four
    years. Statistics are called dry, but these faithful women did not find them so. Mrs.
    Nichols said in reference to her report of the department: "A wail as of a lost
    spirit goes surging through it; moans of woe sound through it; tears and blood flow
    through it."</p>
    <center>
      <b>"Touch not, taste not, handle not."</b>
    </center>
    <p>"Inducing Corporations and Employers to require Total Abstinence in their
    Employees" was the name of the department as adopted in 1880&mdash;Mrs. Peter
    Stryker, of Saratoga, superintendent. After two years of service she was succeeded by
    Mrs. V. A. Willard, of Belmont, who continued the work for one year; then Mrs. Homer
    A. Nelson, of Poughkeepsie, was given the superintendency, which she retained until
    1887. The work of the department was then suspended for one year, but resumed as
    "Capital and Labor"&mdash;Mrs. Nelson again the superintendent. In 1889 work among
    railroad employees was added. In 1890 the name was again changed to "Temperance and
    Labor"&mdash;Mrs. M. M. Van Benschoten, of Newark, superintendent. In 1891 Mrs. Ella
    A. Boole, of West New Brighton, was made the superintendent, and has continued until
    the present. The department has wonderfully developed through her influence.</p>
    <p>"Influencing Physicians not to Prescribe Alcoholics in Medicine" was the original
    name of the present Department of Non-Alcoholics in Medicine. This department was
    first adopted in 1883, with Mrs. Rev. J. Butler, of Fairport, as superintendent.
    During her four years of service the work was well organized.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> The "Physician's Pledge" was
    circulated, and much sentiment created against alcoholic prescriptions. Mrs. E.G.
    Moore, of Medina, who succeeded her, secured the presentation of the subject before
    medical associations. Susan A. Everett, M.D., of New York, was superintendent for one
    year. In 1889 Mrs. M.M. Allen, of Bellona, was appointed superintendent, a position
    occupied by her at the present time. Through her efficiency and zeal knowledge upon
    the subject has increased until now the consensus of opinion is that alcoholic
    medicines are unnecessary.</p>
    <center>
      <b>"Visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children."</b>
    </center>
    <p>"Heredity," as the department now stands in our lines of work, is a scientific
    subject, and should be studied as such. To accomplish this has been the aim of the
    superintendents having the work in charge. This department was adopted in 1883, with
    Mrs. Mary E. Niles, of Hornellsville, as superintendent. In the same year Elvira V.
    Ranier, M.D., of Oswego, was made superintendent of "Hygiene," also a new department.
    In 1884 these departments were united, Mrs. Niles still remaining superintendent. The
    next year Hygiene as a special work was discontinued. The Heredity work remained in
    charge of its first superintendent until 1888, when Sarah Morris, M.D., of Buffalo,
    had the work for one year. In 1889 the department of Health, which had been adopted
    in 1886, with Mrs. Mary G. Underhill, of Poughkeepsie, as its superintendent, was
    united with Heredity, and Gertrude G. Bishop, M.D., of Brooklyn, appointed
    superintendent. The following year the Health Department was discontinued. Mrs. E.T.
    Howland, now Rev. Elizabeth T. Howland, was appointed the superintendent of Heredity.
    She continued the work two years, and was succeeded by Mrs. Ella B. Hallock, of
    Southold.</p>
    <p>"Physical Culture," now "Physical Education," an evolution of the departments of
    Health and Hygiene, was made a distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48"
    id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> department of work in 1890, with Mrs. Bertha Morris
    Smith, of Elmira, as superintendent, a position she has retained until the present.
    Mrs. Smith is an enthusiast in her department. The national leaflet, "A New Field for
    Educators," was written by her in the interests of this department.</p>
    <center>
      <b>"The pen is mightier than the sword."</b>
    </center>
    <p>"The Press," or "Influencing the Press," as the department was first known, was
    adopted as a department in 1880. Miss Margaret E. Winslow served as superintendent
    from 1880 to 1886, with the exception of 1882, when Mrs. O. N. Fletcher, of Sherman,
    acted in that capacity. Miss Abbie E. Hufstader, of Yorkshire Center, had the
    superintendency in 1887, and Miss S. J. Vosburg, of Rochester, in 1888 and 1889. She
    was succeeded by Mrs. May Morgan McKoon, of Long Eddy, who has prosecuted the work
    with vigor until the present time. Listen to the report echoes of this
    department:</p>
    <p>1882&mdash;"The press goes <i>everywhere</i>; let us then walk boldly and steadily
    into this ever-opening door."</p>
    <p>1892&mdash;"The greatest single force in society to-day is the press." "As a man
    readeth in his newspaper, so is he." "Its utterances carry a dictum unequaled by that
    of either the pulpit or bench." "It molds public opinion." "Use the press!"</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p><b>"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God? If any man defile the temple of
      God, him shall God destroy."</b></p>
    </div>
    <p>With this motto "Narcotics" was adopted as a department of State work in 1887,
    with Mrs. Helen L. Bullock, of Elmira, as superintendent. She no sooner entered upon
    the work than measures were inaugurated to secure a law prohibiting the use of
    tobacco by the young. In 1889 such a law was passed. Were it rigidly enforced, fewer
    cases of insanity and less deaths would result from excessive cigarette smoking.
    During her superin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg
    49]</a></span>tendency Mrs. Bullock wrote the national leaflet, "The Tobacco
    Toboggan," and delivered her narcotic lecture, "Our Dangerous Inheritance," many
    times. In 1891-92 Mrs. E.G. Tiffany, of Dansville, was superintendent of the
    department. In 1893 Mrs. Emma G. Dietrick, of Lockport, succeeded her.</p>
    <p>"Franchise" was adopted as a department of state work in 1886, Miss Mary B.
    Cushman, of Lockport, being the first superintendent. In 1888 Mrs. C.C. Ellerson, of
    New York City, succeeded her. In 1891 Miss Vinnie R. Davis, of Orwell, was appointed
    superintendent, a position she still retains. Miss Davis has brought to the work rare
    gifts and great earnestness. The department has steadily advanced under her guidance.
    In the earlier years of the organization great conservatism existed in regard to this
    subject. Resolutions adverse to its consideration by local and state unions were
    passed in 1876 and 1878. Since its adoption as a department the president in her
    annual addresses has continually sounded its keynote in utterances like these: "The
    ballot in woman's hand is a first necessity toward the solution of not only this
    great question but other moral reform questions of our day." "Justice and equity
    alike demand that the ballot be given to women."</p>
    <p>In 1893 two hundred thousand women registered in the state to vote for school
    officers. Upon the eve of the election Judge Williams, of the supreme court, decided
    that such voting would be unconstitutional; but in spite of the ruling over twenty
    thousand women did vote.</p>

    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
    <h4>(FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT)</h4>
    <p>Ella, eldest daughter of Colonel Isaac N. and Rebecca Alban Alexander, was born at
    Van Wert, Ohio. Although but a school-girl then, she was one of the original Ohio
    crusaders, and the temperance zeal kindled at that time with her has never grown
    cold.</p>
    <p>In 1874 she was graduated from the high school of her native place as
    valedictorian of the class. Four years later she completed her college course at the
    University of Wooster, Ohio, with a class of thirty-one, only three of whom were
    young women. This time she was salutatorian. During the university course she
    captured the prize in an oratorical contest, being the only lady among nine
    contestants. This was an earnest of the honor conferred upon her in 1888, when she
    was invited to deliver the oration before the alumni association of her <i>alma
    mater</i>, the first time in the history of the university that this honor had been
    conferred upon a woman.</p>
    <p>After graduating from college and refusing many flattering positions, she became a
    teacher of Latin, Greek, and higher mathematics in the high school of Van Wert, and
    in 1881 the degree of Master of Arts was awarded her. As an educator she began her
    public work at teachers' institutes.</p>
    <p>In 1883 she was married to Rev. Wm. H. Boole, D.D., pastor of the South Second
    street Methodist Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, N.Y., and found a wide and congenial
    field of usefulness in this new relation as a pastor's wife.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Boole was elected corresponding secretary of the Woman's Christian Temperance
    Union of New York State at the Cortland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52"
    id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> convention, in 1885, a position she filled with
    marked ability for six years. In 1891 she was elected to the office of first
    vice-president, a position she still retains. Mrs. Boole was chairman of the
    committee which prepared the handbook, which has been invaluable to the workers of
    the state.</p>
    <p>Since 1888 Dr. and Mrs. Boole have devoted their time wholly to temperance and
    evangelistic work. No name is more familiar among temperance speakers than Mrs.
    Boole's, and no voice has been heard in this state more frequently or with greater
    acceptance than hers. Her lectures are a happy mingling of humor, pathos, and logic.
    They give no uncertain sound for total abstinence and prohibition, and never fail to
    interest.</p>
    <p>This sketch would hardly be complete without mention of Albenia Alexander, now
    eight years old, only daughter of Mrs. Boole. "Benie" was presented to the state
    convention at Binghamton, and to the national convention at Nashville a few weeks
    later, as "the youngest white-ribboner of us all."</p>

    his was the first motto chosen for the Evangelistic Department, and has been the
    foundation-stone of the work. It will be impossible in this little book to mention
    the work which has been done&mdash;indeed, it could not be recorded&mdash;but one is
    our Master, even Christ, and He knows it all. We can only mention the different lines
    of work which have come under this head, with the names of those who have acted as
    superintendents.</p>
    <p>The Evangelistic Department was placed in charge of Mrs. Mary E. Hartt, of
    Brooklyn, in 1880, who gave to it her best thought and energy. She continued in the
    work for eight years, laying it down only in response to the Master's call, "Come up
    higher." Mrs. Josephine Braman, of Brooklyn, succeeded Mrs. Hartt for her unexpired
    term, she being succeeded in turn by Mrs. Mary J. Weaver, of Batavia, in 1889, who
    has carried on the department work most efficiently since then.</p>
    <p>For two years the Department of Systematic Giving was added to this, but in 1893
    was made a department by itself, with Mrs. Nellie Hutchinson, of Owego, as
    superintendent.</p>
    <p>In 1886 the Sabbath Observance Department was given to Mrs. Mary E. Simpson, of
    Sherman, who was followed by Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54"
    id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> H.L. Wilcox, of Rochester, each serving two years.
    Mrs. Margaret P. Buchanan, of New York City, was appointed in 1890, Mrs. James
    Baldwin, of Addison, in 1891, and in 1893 Miss Kate Manning, of Attica, was made
    superintendent.</p>
    <p>Mrs. K.E. Cleveland, of Brooklyn, and Mrs. Emma G. Dietrick, of Lockport, each
    served for two years in securing day of prayer in week of prayer.</p>
    <p>Mrs. A.G. Nichols, of Kingston, and Mrs. R.A. Esmond, of Syracuse, alternated as
    superintendent of the Unfermented Wine Department from 1880 to 1888, at which time
    the work was taken up by Mrs. P.J. Adams, of Moravia, who still continues in the
    department.</p>
    <p>Prison and Jail Work in 1880 was in charge of Miss C.E. Coffin, of Brooklyn; in
    1881, of Mrs. Knapp, of Auburn; and in 1882 Mrs. Frances D. Hall, of Plattsburg, was
    appointed, and continued as superintendent for five years. The next two years Mrs.
    Richard Bloom, of Auburn, filled the position, and in 1890 Miss C.E. Coffin was again
    made superintendent, the work in almshouses being added. This was changed the
    following year, the Department of Almshouse Work being placed with that of Flower
    Mission, and both given to Miss Anna L. Thompson, of Newburgh, who had been made
    superintendent of Flower Mission Work in 1890. Previous to this time, commencing in
    1888, Miss Lydia Howell, of Poughkeepsie (afterward Mrs. Albert A. Reed), had been
    the superintendent. In 1880 Reformatory and Almshouse Work was taken up, and Mrs.
    T.J. Bissell, of Corning, acted as superintendent for two years, and Mrs. C.C.
    Alford, of Brooklyn, for one year, after which no superintendent was appointed.</p>
    <p>Sunday-school Work has had a number of superintendents, Mrs. Allen Butler, of
    Syracuse, being the first, serving two years. Mrs. S.R. Gray, of Albany, served
    during the next two years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
    55]</a></span> Mrs. C. L. Harris taking it in 1884, to be followed by Mrs. Gray again
    in 1885. Next came Mrs. Julia A. Bidwell, of Hartford, for three years, and in 1889
    Mrs. T. M. Foster, of Verona, was given the department. She was succeeded by Mrs. S.
    A. Kenney, of Troy, who, after two years service, was succeeded by Mrs. Bidwell, now
    of Deposit, the present superintendent.</p>
    <p>In 1889 Work among the Colored was added to the departments, and the work given in
    charge of Mrs. Maria R. Douglass, of New York City. In 1891 Miss Sara Collins, of
    Cortland, was made superintendent.</p>
    <p>Foreign Work was made a department in 1883 and was continued for eight years, the
    following ladies acting as superintendents during that time: Mrs. A. K. Knox, of New
    York City; Mrs. C. E. Cleveland, of Perry; Mrs. E. F. Lord, of New York City; Mrs. E.
    M. J. Decker, of Victor; Miss Rachel Carney, of Tonawanda; Mrs. Clara Vigelius, of
    New York City, and Mrs. George Aldrich, of Dutchess Junction.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Sarah A. McClees, of Yonkers, was made superintendent of the Department of
    Soldiers and Sailors in 1883, and continued as such for three years, Mrs. W. W. Hoag,
    of Akron, being next chosen. After one year Miss Emma Nason, of Blodgett Mills, was
    appointed, and in 1888 the work was given to Mrs. Mary D. Ferguson, of Syracuse, who
    is still the superintendent.</p>
    <p>Mothers' Meetings were first taken up in 1881, with Mrs. Horace Eaton, of Palmyra,
    as superintendent. In 1883 Parlor Meetings were added, Mrs. Eaton still in charge.
    The following year Mrs. Van Benschoten, of Newark, was appointed, and in 1886 Parlor
    Meetings was made a department by itself, and Mothers' Meetings placed in charge of
    Mrs. Caroline B. Randall, of Oswego. In 1888 Social Purity and Mothers' Meetings were
    combined, with Mrs. Mary J. Weaver, of Batavia, superintendent for one year. She was
    succeeded by Mrs. Anna E. Rice, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56"
    id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> Batavia. The Department of Social Purity was first
    taken up in 1886, Mrs. Mary T. Burt being the superintendent until it was combined
    with Mothers' Meetings.</p>
    <p>From 1888 until the present time the Department of Peace and Arbitration has had
    but one superintendent, Mrs. Sarah W. Collins, of Purchase, who has most faithfully
    carried forward the work.</p>
    <p>Under the head of Police Matron Work, Mrs. Harriet Goff, of Brooklyn, did advance
    work, and it was Mrs. Goff who, as chairman of the standing committee on Police
    Matron Work, introduced into the legislature the bill making the law for police
    matrons mandatory in New York and Brooklyn. The work has since been made a
    department, with Dr. Sarah Morris, of Buffalo, as superintendent.</p>
    <p>Rescue Work for Girls, a new department, was added in 1893, and placed in charge
    of Mrs. Mary J. Annable, of Brooklyn. This promises to be a most helpful and blessed
    line of work.</p>
    <p>These lines of work are all evangelistic in their nature, and not until the
    records are read "up yonder" shall we know of the victories won "In His Name."</p>

    <h2>MRS. FRANCES W. GRAHAM.</h2>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
    <h4>(CORRESPONDING SECRETARY)</h4>
    <p>Mrs. Graham is just entering upon the fourth year of her office as corresponding
    secretary of our state union, and in this time she has eminently proved her fitness
    for the position and earned the title of "a model secretary." Born in Lockport, N.Y.,
    she became identified with temperance work as a child, first belonging to a juvenile
    society known as Cold Water Templars, and later becoming a member of the Sons of
    Temperance and Good Templars. She is active in all Christian work, being a member of
    the First Congregational Church of Lockport, in whose church work she takes prominent
    part, and whose solo soprano she has been for thirteen years; she is also an active
    member of the Christian Endeavor society and the King's Daughters.</p>
    <p>In 1880 she was married to Almon Graham, whose help has made it possible for her
    to enter more fully into temperance work than she otherwise could have done. She was
    president of the Lockport Woman's Christian Temperance Union four years, and
    corresponding secretary of the Niagara County Woman's Christian Temperance Union for
    the same length of time. In December, 1890, she was appointed <i>Union Signal</i>
    reporter for the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and her reports have
    called forth warm commendation from editors and constituency alike for their
    conciseness and delightful presentation of facts.</p>
    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
    <p>Mrs. Graham possesses pre-eminently the divine "gift of song." Her voice, a
    sympathetic mezzo-soprano, goes straight to the heart, and its sweet tones linger
    there long after the words have ceased. At the state convention at Jamestown in
    October, 1894, she was musical director, and by vote of the convention is now
    entering upon a service of song for the unions throughout the state.</p>
    <p>During her term of office her work has been of inestimable value to the state. Her
    initiation into the work of corresponding secretary of the state union was strong and
    vigorous. In October, 1891, she was elected secretary, and it was during the winter
    of 1891-92 that the legislative work was done that resulted in closing the state's
    exhibit at the World's Fair on the Sabbath, defeating the barmaid bill, modifying the
    infamous bill of the State Liquor Dealers' Association, and preventing the
    introduction of the bill to legalize social vice. Mrs. Graham had printed and sent
    out all the petitions and protests relative to the above bills. Every senator and
    assemblyman was addressed by her by letter, and her prompt and unfailing response to
    every urgent request was a large factor in the success achieved. She was then and is
    now always ready for "the next thing," and her sweet willingness of spirit is a
    constant source of comfort and inspiration to her fellow-workers. During the past
    year she sent out the petitions to the constitutional convention at Albany&mdash;one
    for the prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors, the other for the full
    enfranchisement of women. She counted all the names (over seventy thousand in
    number), pasted the petitions on white cloth (and when done they were over a third of
    a mile in length), tied them with white ribbon, and sent them to Albany for the
    committee to present. The work to her is a constant delight. Nothing is ever too
    hard&mdash;"It is such a privilege to do it," she earnestly says; and how well she
    does it, the work and the state bear witness.</p>
    <p>Last year she was appointed one of the committee to prepare the history of the
    State Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and has given much time and thought to the
    work. Mrs. Graham is young in years, but already her work has told for God and
    humanity. Should her life be spared, what blessings may we not hope for the cause
    through her consecration and ability?</p>

    s "all roads lead to Rome," so the legality of temperance measures is reached through
    legislation; and many times has the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, with
    memorial, petition, and protest, marched over the roads leading to the legislative
    halls of municipality, state, and nation, asking for the enacting of new laws or the
    better enforcement of old ones.</p>
    <p>This policy was inaugurated at the first convention, in the memorial prepared for
    presentation to President Grant and Governor Dix, and has been continued with varying
    success through the subsequent years. At the second annual convention a memorial was
    prepared for congress and the state legislature, from the last of which a single
    article is quoted, viz.: "That no license to sell intoxicating drinks in any place be
    issued except when a majority of women residents, as well as men, above the age of
    twenty-one years, desire such license granted." This memorial enrolled 6,328 names,
    and was presented to the legislature by Mrs. Allen Butler and Mrs. Mary T. Burt. Had
    the request been granted at that time, and its enforcement continued, the license
    question would now be solved.</p>
    <p>April 12, 1882, the first petition to the state legislature for a prohibitory
    constitutional amendment was presented by Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60"
    id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Mary T. Burt and Mrs. E.M.J. Decker. The petition
    contained 10,431 names. Mrs Burt, in reporting the work at the next convention, said
    "A page carried the bulky document to the desk, and during its passage thereto a
    smile crept over faces of members and dignified speaker alike, so large was its
    circumference."</p>
    <p>As early as 1877 a memorial had been prepared relative to temperance teaching in
    the public schools, but not until 1884 was the law secured. After the annual
    convention of 1883 this work was prosecuted with vigor. Public meetings were held and
    petitions circulated in its behalf. These petitions recorded 57,419 names. February
    5, 1884, the bill passed the senate, twenty-two voting for and two against it; March
    3 it passed the assembly, the vote being ninety-eight to two; March 10, 1884, Grover
    Cleveland, then governor of the State of New York, signed the same, and it thus
    became a law of the state. The text of the law is as follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>AN ACT relating to the Study of Physiology and Hygiene in the Public
      Schools.</p>
      <p>SECTION I. Provision shall be made by the proper local school authorities for
      instructing all pupils in all schools supported by public money, or under state
      control, in physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the effects of
      alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system.</p>
      <p>SEC. 2. No certificate shall be granted any person to teach in the public
      schools of the State of New York, after the first day of January, eighteen hundred
      and eighty-five, who has not passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and
      hygiene, with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and
      narcotics upon the human system.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1883 the second petition for a prohibitory constitutional amendment was
    presented to the senate and assembly. It was defeated in the house by a vote of
    forty-two to fifty-four, and in the senate by a vote of thirteen to eighteen. Yet
    these figures show that the prohibition tide is rising.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
    <p>In 1886 measures were taken toward securing a law prohibiting the sale of
    intoxicants upon fair grounds. Mrs. H. Roscoe Edgett, of Fairport, the superintendent
    of the department, was indefatigable in her efforts to secure the law, but it was not
    until February 29, 1888, that the following was enrolled on the statute-books of the
    state:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>It shall not be lawful for any person to sell, have for sale, give away, or have
      in his possession for the purpose of selling or giving away, on the grounds or
      premises on or in which any state, county, town, or other agricultural or
      horticultural fair is being held, any strong or spirituous liquors, wine, ale,
      beer, or fermented cider; and it shall not be lawful for any person to sell or give
      away strong or spirituous liquors, wines, ales, beer, or fermented cider at any
      place within two hundred yards of the grounds or premises on or in which any state,
      county, town, or any other agricultural or horticultural fair is being held. This
      act shall not be applicable to the city of New York.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Until 1887 the laws of the state were such that a child ten years old could
    consent to her own ruin, and the despoiler of her virtue go unpunished. In April of
    that year the penal code was amended, raising the age of consent to sixteen years, as
    follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p> ... Any person who takes or detains a female under sixteen years of age for the
      purpose of prostitution, ... is guilty of abduction, punishable by imprisonment for
      not more than five years, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Following closely upon this was the passage of the police matron law, in 1888,
    which provided for the appointment of police matrons in all cities of more than
    25,000 inhabitants, and the designating of separate houses of detention for female
    delinquents. In securing this law the Woman's Christian Temperance Union co-operated
    with other societies. In 1891 an amendment to this law was secured, mainly through
    the efforts of Mrs. H.K.N. Goff, of Brooklyn, making the appointment of police<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> matrons compulsory
    in the cities of New York and Brooklyn. The law as amended is as follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>SECTION I. The mayor of every city in this state according to the last state or
      national census containing a population of 25,000 or over, excepting the cities of
      New York and Brooklyn, and in the cities of New York and Brooklyn the boards of
      commissioners of police of said cities respectively, shall, within three months
      after the passage of this act, designate one or more station-houses within their
      respective cities for the detention and confinement of all women under arrest in
      said cities....</p>
    </div>
    <p>Through the efforts of Mrs. Helen L. Bullock, of Elmira, the following narcotic
    law was secured in 1889:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>LAWS OF NEW YORK&mdash;CHAPTER 170.</p>
      <p>An act to amend Section 291 of the Penal Code, relating to Children; became a
      law, with the approval of the Governor, April 22, 1889.</p>
      <p><i>The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do
      enact as follows</i>:</p>
      <p>SECTION I. Section 291 of the Penal Code is hereby amended so as to read as
      follows:</p>
      <p>A person who sells, pays for, or furnishes any cigar, cigarette, or tobacco in
      any of its forms to any child, actually or apparently under the age of sixteen
      years, <i>is guilty of a misdemeanor</i>.</p>
      <p>SEC. 2. This act shall take effect immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1890 it was amended, attaching a penalty for its violation, as follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>AN ACT to amend Section 291 of the Penal Code, relating to Children; approved by
      the Governor, May 24, 1890.</p>
      <p>SECTION I. Section 291 of the Penal Code is hereby amended by adding thereto the
      following subdivision:</p>
      <p>7. No child, actually or apparently under sixteen years of age, shall smoke or
      in any way use any cigar, cigarette, or tobacco in any form whatsoever, in any
      public street, place, or resort. A violation of this subdivision <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>shall be a
      misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten dollars and not less
      than two dollars for each offense.</p>
      <p>SEC. 2. This act shall take effect on the first day of September, eighteen
      hundred and ninety.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1891 an effort was made to introduce the English system of barmaids into the
    saloons of New York City. This no sooner became known to the members of the Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union than an effort was made to secure a law prohibiting the
    movement. This was effected by the passage of the following act, April 25, 1892:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>AN ACT forbidding the hiring of Barmaids.</p>
      <p><i>The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do
      enact as follows</i>:</p>
      <p>SECTION I. No female shall be hired as barmaid, or to compound or dispense
      intoxicating beverages in any place where the same are sold or offered for
      sale.</p>
      <p>SEC. 2. A person who hires, or causes to be hired, any female as barmaid, or to
      compound or dispense intoxicating beverages in any place where the same are sold or
      offered for sale, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
      <p>SEC. 3. This act shall take effect immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Thus, at its very inception, legislative enactment prevented the introduction into
    this state of a most demoralizing phase of the saloon business.</p>
    <p>In the same year and month a law forbidding the opening of the New York State
    exhibit at the Columbian Exhibition was passed, thus placing New York State on record
    as favoring the sanctity of the Sabbath.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>AN ACT in relation to the Exhibit of the State of New York at the World's

    <p>The following protests were presented to the legislature, receiving such
    consideration that the subjects had no hearing:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <center>
        <b>AGAINST THE ENACTMENT OF A LAW LICENSING VICE.</b>
      </center>
      <br />
      <p><i>To the Senate and Assembly of the State of New York</i>:</p>
      <p>WHEREAS, It has come to our knowledge that a bill providing for the regulation
      and licensing of vice in the cities and towns of the State of New York will be
      introduced in the legislature, and that one of the provisions of the bill is the
      compulsory medical examination of women who are inmates of the establishments named
      therein, we respectfully submit the following in relation to it:</p>
      <p>It puts a premium on the social evil.</p>
      <p>It makes this terrible vice a branch of municipal government, and the state a
      partner in it.</p>
      <p>It inflicts the degradation of compulsory medical examination upon women, and
      lets their paramours go free.</p>
      <p>It is an outrage upon womanhood, and means the practical slavery of an
      unfortunate class of women.</p>
      <p>We realize all the shame of the bill, and feel its introduction in the
      legislature to be an insult to the great State of New York.</p>
      <p><i>We emphatically</i> PROTEST <i>against its consideration</i>, and appeal to
      you to use your influence and, if necessary, your votes against this dreadful and
      infamous bill.</p>

        <b>AGAINST THE EXCISE BILL OF THE STATE LIQUOR DEALERS' ASSOCIATION.</b>
      </center>
      <br />
      <p>WHEREAS, A bill prepared by the State Liquor Dealers' Association is before your
      honorable body, which provides for a Sunday license law (which means unrestrained
      liquor on the Sabbath); for special licenses for certain saloons in certain
      localities in cities; for the sale of wine and beer after one o'clock in the
      morning at public balls and entertainments given by any incorporated association;
      abolishes the requirement of real estate security on license bonds (thus striking a
      blow at the civil damage act); and makes it a misdemeanor for any person to enter a
      saloon during the hours when it is supposed to be closed in obedience to the
      law:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
      <p>Now, therefore, as every one of the above provisions is a direct blow at public
      morality, at law and order, at the peace and happiness of the home and family, and
      as this bill means for the state more drunkenness, more crimes and outrages of
      every sort, more poverty, more suffering, more darkened lives and ruined homes, we,
      the undersigned, citizens of &mdash;&mdash;, county of &mdash;&mdash;,
      most emphatically protest against its passage, and we call upon you, our
      representatives, to use your influence and vote against it.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The years 1891 and 1892 were not only marked by legislative work, but by petition
    work as well. Two successive legislatures had voted to submit to the people a
    prohibitory constitutional amendment, the vote to be taken in April, 1892. In
    anticipation of this event, petitions were circulated throughout the state in behalf
    at this cause, the grand total of 109,057 names being secured. Through the failure of
    the legislature to pass an enabling act to provide for the expense of the election,
    the amendment was never submitted.</p>
    <p>Not discouraged by this apparent fruitless expenditure of time and strength,
    during the winter and spring of 1893-94 petition work was again resumed, the
    constitutional convention in session at Albany from May until September being the
    objective point. Two petitions were circulated at this time, one for an amendment to
    the constitution providing for the prohibition of the liquor traffic; the other for
    the full enfranchisement of women. Through winter's cold and summer's heat this work
    went bravely on, and 37,624 names were secured to the prohibition petition, and
    36,086 to the one asking for woman's enfranchisement. These petitions were pasted on
    cloth, in a double row of names, and measured, when done, 475 yards. Mrs. Graham, who
    had them in charge, after pasting, arranged them in four large rolls and tied each
    with a white satin ribbon. June 28, 1894, they were presented to the constitutional
    convention, producing a profound impression by their magnitude. Mrs. Burt and
    Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> Tenney
    appeared before the convention. Mrs. Burt was granted a hearing. The convention did
    not recommend either of these measures, but that of woman's suffrage received much
    attention, being defeated by a vote of ninety-seven to fifty-eight. The momentum
    received from this petition effort will not soon be lost.</p>
    <p>Thus in brief the legislative and petition work is reported, but it only vaguely
    represents the expenditure of time and strength devoted to this work. Truly it may be
    said of the women of New York State, "Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou
    excellest them all."</p>

    <h4>(RECORDING SECRETARY)</h4>
    <p>The recording secretary of our state union has filled this important position for
    twelve years, and was elected for the thirteenth time at Jamestown in October, 1894.
    She has rare qualifications for the office, as has been evidenced by her faithful
    services during all these years.</p>
    <p>She said, "There is positively nothing in my life of the least interest to the
    public," when requested to furnish a few items for the basis of this sketch. But the
    life of one who can sit steadily through three long days of a state convention,
    faithfully recording motions, amendments, amendments to the amendment, substitutes,
    and the thousand-and-one things that make up the business of one of the great
    meetings of the Empire State, and then come into the post-executive committee meeting
    with eye, brain, and hand alert, ready to record a day's crowded work for that body,
    must perforce contain much of interest, for these are qualities which everyone does
    not possess.</p>
    <p>In addition to her convention duties she compiles the state reports, which are
    models of excellence as to style, finish, and completeness.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Gardenier was born in Oswego county, New York, and was educated in the high
    and normal schools of Oswego City. She is the daughter of John and Mary Tenney
    Remington. At the age of sixteen she professed Christ and joined the First Baptist
    Church of Oswego, of which she is still a member. She began at once to teach in the
    Sabbath-school, and has continued the work with very little interruption up to the
    present time, holding now the position of assistant superintendent.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
    <p>Home and foreign missions have claimed her interest, and she is associational
    director of the women's Baptist home mission work for the county, under appointment
    of the Women's Home Mission Board at Chicago.</p>
    <p>In 1863 she was married to Mr. W. H. Gardenier, a lawyer, and has one son. Mrs.
    Gardenier is an experienced and very successful teacher, having filled that important
    and influential role for many years. During all these years her pupils have been
    largely boys and young men, over whom she has a peculiar and happy faculty. Her
    influence upon the lives of the hundreds of boys who have sat under her teaching
    cannot be estimated.</p>
    <p>She has for many years been interested in temperance. Her first public work was
    done in connection with the Good Templars, having joined the order at its
    organization. When the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was organized she became a
    member of the local union of her city, and has since that time been prominently
    connected with the temperance work of the city and county. She assisted in organizing
    the county Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and served as its secretary seven
    years. She organized many of the unions of the County, and to her enthusiasm and zeal
    much of the early success of the county work is attributed.</p>
    <p>At the Binghamton convention, in 1887, she was presented with a beautiful gold
    watch and chain as a slight recognition of her faithful and untiring services.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Gardenier is noted not only for her gifts as a "recorder" but for her wit,
    which, expressing itself with the utmost good will, awards extreme delight to her
    hearers. Her addresses are marked by forcible and original illustrations which remain
    in the memory and challenge thought long after the occasion of their delivery.</p>
    <p>At Round Lake, in the summer of 1884, under the scientific<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> temperance instruction law of 1884,
    Mrs. Gardenier gave the first illustrated lesson in the state upon the nature and
    effects of alcohol upon the human system, and has since presented the subject of
    scientific temperance instruction at a number of the teachers' institutes in the
    state.</p>
    <p>In addition to her temperance work, she is deeply interested in the humane work
    and other public philanthropies.</p>
    <p>A member of the committee to prepare the history of the State Woman's Christian
    Temperance Union, much time during the past few months has been devoted to searching
    the records and statistics of the past twenty years, twelve of which bear witness to
    the faithfulness, love, and zeal of our recording secretary.</p>

    </div><p>
    ur work is many-sided, but among all the rest the social side has not been neglected.
    When department work was first taken up, in 1880, a department called "Drawing-Room
    Meetings" was placed in charge of Mrs. Mary C. Johnson, of Brooklyn, who for two
    years was the superintendent. The following year Mrs. Margaret Bottome, of New York,
    now at the head of the order of King's Daughters and Sons, was the superintendent. In
    1883 the department was changed to Parlor Meetings and united with Mothers' Meetings,
    Mrs. Dr. Horace Eaton being given the superintendency. She was succeeded by Mrs. Van
    Benschoten, of Newark, who filled the position for two years. In 1886 the two
    departments were divided, and Mrs. A.M. Wickes, of Attica, was given that of Parlor
    Meetings, holding it until the present time. In the convention of 1893 a beautiful
    chocolate pot was presented to the union at Gouverneur, St. Lawrence county, for
    having held more parlor meetings during the year than any other union in the
    state.</p>
    <p>Ten years ago the Department of State and County Fairs was adopted, and Mrs. H. R.
    Edgett, of Fairport, was made the superintendent. She has given ten years of faithful
    service to this line of work. In 1889 a committee was appointed to con<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>sider the work at
    the state fair, and, if deemed practicable, the state was to engage in the work. Mrs.
    Mary T. Burt, Mrs. Ellen L. Tenney, and Mrs. Edgett were made such a committee.
    Correspondence was immediately opened with the officers of the agricultural society
    as to the feasibility of erecting a building on the permanent fair grounds at
    Syracuse, and shortly after a circular-letter was sent out, asking for contributions
    for the same. Arrangements were made to commence the work there at once, not waiting
    for the building to be erected, and the fall of 1890 found our standard raised for
    the first time on the state fair grounds. The building is not yet accomplished, but
    with $2,065.99 already set aside for it, it is certainly an assured fact, and but for
    the illness of Mrs. Burt would no doubt have been erected during the summer of
    1894.</p>
    <p>The heroic labors of Mrs. Burt during these years deserve more than a passing
    notice. Upon her rested the burdens of the work. Her courage in encountering
    difficulties, her patient endurance of fatigue and exposure, and her wonderful
    executive ability, made her a wonder to all. The sun has not always shone during the
    state fair, and through storm and sunshine&mdash;mostly storm&mdash;she has stood at
    her post, thinking no sacrifice too great if thereby our cause be advanced. Mrs. Mary
    D. Ferguson, of Syracuse, has always stood bravely by, aiding in every way
    possible.</p>
    <p>A paper was issued, called <i>The Fair White Ribbon</i>, and fifteen thousand
    copies distributed freely on the grounds. For two years the paper was edited by Mrs.
    H.R. Edgett, when, her health failing, Mrs. Ferguson acted as editor and publisher.
    Advertisements were secured by Mrs. Ferguson, and a handsome profit of $139 was the
    result the second year, and $147 the third year; while the good accomplished through
    the presence and efforts of our standard-bearers on the grounds cannot be
    measured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> In
    1891 the Department of Coffee Houses was added to the social lines, and Mrs. S. W.
    Stoddard, of Horseheads, was placed at the head of the department. No change has been
    made in the superintendency, and a new impetus has been given to this work since it
    has been made a department.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <h3>POLITICAL.</h3>
    <p>The Woman's Christian Temperance Union has frequently been called a political
    institution. While we smile over the accusation, knowing how small a part woman can
    occupy in the politics of this country, yet with great earnestness we back up the
    smile with the thought that when we <i>are</i> a political institution&mdash;or, more
    properly speaking, a <i>voting</i> institution&mdash;the backbone of the liquor power
    will be broken, <i>the saloon must go</i>, and the era of happy hearts and happy
    homes will be ushered in. That we have always taken an interest in politics is true,
    and always on the right side. Away back in 1876 we find the following:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That, in view of the present political crisis, we as Christian
      women effectively urge upon all voters with whom we have influence that they cast
      their votes only for total abstinence candidates.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1883 our convention received the following telegram from Syracuse:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p><i>To the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of New York State:</i></p>
      <p>Prohibitory party convention sends greeting. Where you lead with prayers, we
      will follow with votes.</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 18em;">DWIGHT WILLIAMS,</span> <span
      style="margin-left: 22em;"><i>Chairman of Committee.</i></span>
    </div>
    <p>The reply sent is found in Joshua i., 9.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73"
    id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
    <p>The convention of 1884 adopted the following resolution, only twelve voting
    against it:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p><i>Resolved</i>, That we express our endorsement of the action of our beloved
      president, Miss Willard, and of the national executive committee, in regard to the
      Prohibition party, as being in harmony with the resolution passed in the national
      convention at Detroit.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In this same year our president attended the nominating convention at Pittsburgh,
    as delegate from the Prohibition convention.</p>
    <p>In 1885, Mrs. Burt in her annual address referred to what is known as the St.
    Louis resolution, which reads as follows:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>We refer to the history of ten years of persistent moral suasion work as fully
      establishing our claim to be called a non-political society, but one which steadily
      follows the white banner of prohibition wherever it may be displayed. We have,
      however, as individuals, always aimed ourselves, in local and state political
      contests, with those voters whose efforts and ballots have been given to the
      removal of the dram-shop and its attendant evils, and at this time, while
      recognizing that our action as a national society is not binding upon states or
      individuals, we reaffirm the positions taken by the society, both at Louisville in
      1882 and at Detroit in 1883, pledging our influence to that party, by whatever name
      called, which shall furnish us the best embodiment of prohibition principles, and
      will most surely protect our homes. And as we now know which national party gives
      as the desired embodiment of the principles for which our ten years' labor has been
      expended, we will continue to lend our influence to the national political
      organization which declares in its platform for national prohibition and home
      protection. In this, as in all progressive effort, we will endeavor to meet
      argument with argument, misjudgment with patience, denunciation with kindness, and
      all difficulties and dangers with prayer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Mrs. Burt adds:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>And distasteful though the word "politics" may be to many in connection with our
      work, we can none of us ignore the fact that the strength of the saloon system,
      which is an open menace to our homes, is vested in political power....<span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
      <p>Political action with regard to woman's temperance work may be decried, our
      influence as an organization may be withheld, but the fact will remain that the
      party which boldly declares for the prohibition of the liquor traffic&mdash;the men
      who, standing solemnly before God, say, "My voice shall be given and my vote shall
      be cast against the legislation of this iniquity,"&mdash;deserves the sympathy,
      prayers, and influence of all women, and will receive the blessing of God.</p>
    </div>
    <p>During the years that have followed these eventful ones we have always come up to
    the standard, and have given no uncertain sound on this question, and in closing this
    chapter we cannot do better than to quote again from Mrs. Burt's address of 1886:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>And in the years to come I believe it will be a fact over which the union will
      rejoice, that when the battle waged the fiercest, when shot and shell rained the
      thickest, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of the state, true to the genius
      of its organization, stepped boldly forth and extended sympathy and influence to
      our brothers who were struggling so bravely for the right, saying, "Here I
      stand&mdash;I can do no other; so help me God."</p>

    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
    <h4>(TREASURER)</h4>
    <p>Mrs. Tenney was born in New Hampshire. Early in life she manifested decided
    literary and musical tastes&mdash;in childhood preferring study to play, and books to
    dolls. Mathematics, music, and the languages were her especial delight; and to these
    she applied herself with such assiduity that at fourteen Greek, Latin, French,
    German, Spanish, and Italian had been added to her English course; at sixteen she
    commenced to play the organ in church.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Tenney was not only a graduate of the Rhode Island Normal School, but later a
    teacher in the same institution; she also taught in Elmwood Literary Institute, near
    Concord, N. H., and in Professor Lincoln's Young Ladies' School, in Providence,
    R.I.</p>
    <p>In 1886 she married Professor Jonathan Tenney, Ph.D. Since that time her home has
    been at Albany, N.Y., where she is surrounded by a wide circle of friends. She is a
    member of the executive committee of the Congregational Woman's Home Missionary Union
    of the State of New York, and president of the Hudson River Association. In addition
    to societies of general interest, she has been actively associated with the
    philanthropic, musical, and literary interests of her own city, occupying many
    positions of trust in connection with them.</p>
    <p>At the state convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of New York held
    at Binghamton in 1886, Mrs. Tenney was elected treasurer of the state organization,
    and at each successive convention has been re-elected. Her taste for mathematics
    serves her well in this important relation. As a treasurer<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> she is the peer of any&mdash;prompt,
    reliable, accurate. We never question her figures; the rest of us may make
    mistakes&mdash;the treasurer <i>never does</i>. She looks after the minutest details
    of everything, and to her watchfulness much of the financial prosperity of the state
    union is due.</p>
    <p>In 1889 a widow's sorrow came to Mrs. Tenney by the death of her noble husband.
    Two sons survived him&mdash;boys of ten and thirteen years, whose education and
    training since that time have devolved upon her.</p>
    <p>Her organ voluntaries at the annual conventions evince a master's skill and
    delight all who listen.</p>
    <p>The Granite State may well be proud of its gifted daughter, and the Empire State,
    especially the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, rejoices in her possession.</p>

    arious matters of importance came up at different times during these years for
    consideration, discussion, and settlement, and in this chapter our aim will be to
    touch upon these points. The chapter will not be as smooth, perhaps, as a chapter in
    a story-book, because of necessity many subjects must be introduced, yet our history
    would not be complete without it. We have searched the records faithfully, and find
    many items of interest which should be recorded here. No attempt will be made to
    weave them into narrative style, as space will not permit.</p>
    <p>In 1880 twenty-five dollars were appropriated toward a testimonial to Mrs. Lucy
    Webb Hayes in recognition of her efficient service in the position which she had
    taken with regard to temperance.</p>
    <p>In this same year women were first recognized as voters at school elections.</p>
    <p>At the ninth annual meeting, held at Oswego, Mrs. Burt was elected president; and
    in her first annual address she recommended the establishing of a state paper. The
    recommendation was adapted, and in December of that year the first number was
    issued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> The
    paper was called <i>Woman's Christian Temperance Work</i>. This proved to be too
    lengthy a name, and so it was shortened to <i>Our Work</i>. Miss Margaret E. Winslow
    was editor and Mrs. C.C. Alford publisher, and through their efforts over thirteen
    hundred subscribers were secured before it reached its first birthday. In 1887 the
    name was changed to <i>Woman's Temperance Work</i>, its present name. This motto for
    the state paper was chosen when the paper was first decided upon: "O woman, great is
    thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt."</p>
    <p>In 1884 the establishment of headquarters was recommended, and in 1886 the
    recommendation was adopted, and rented headquarters were secured in New York City,
    with Mrs. R.A. Thurston, of Poughkeepsie, as office secretary, her duties to include
    the publication of the state paper. Mrs. Thurston was also made organizing secretary,
    and did valiant work as such for several years. New York is the only state which has
    had an organizing secretary&mdash;a fact which is worthy of note. Previous to Mrs.
    Thurston's appointment, Mrs. E.H. Griffith, of Fairport, had done splendid work as
    organizing secretary, in connection with her work as state corresponding secretary.
    In 1887 Mrs. C.C. Shaffer, of Newburgh, was made office secretary, and in 1888 Mrs.
    Ella C. Viele was appointed, and continued as editor and publisher for two years. She
    was succeeded by Miss Julia E. Dailey, of Rochester, in 1891, who still holds the
    office, doing faithful work.</p>
    <p>In 1888 the president recommended that steps be taken to secure permanent
    headquarters. A committee was appointed to consider the recommendation and plans were
    presented for raising funds. The committee was continued with instructions to keep
    the matter before the people.</p>
    <p>Evidently the white-ribboners believe not only in "praying," but in "watching"
    also, for in 1884 Mrs. Burt was presented with a beautiful gold watch as a
    testimonial of her years of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
    79]</a></span> service, first as recording secretary, then as corresponding
    secretary, and after that as president. In 1886 Miss Julia Colman was "watched" in
    the same manner, this being the tenth anniversary of her superintendency of the
    Literature Department; and in 1888, at Binghamton, the convention "set a watch" upon
    Mrs. G.M. Gardenier, the recording secretary. An elegant gold chain was added by the
    executive committee. These facts show on the "face" of them that all "hands" approve
    of "watchfulness."</p>
    <p>In 1888 a handbook was prepared by a committee composed of Mrs. Ella A. Boole,
    Mrs. Helen L. Bullock, and Mrs. E.H. Griffith, which proved very helpful to the
    workers. The following year it was revised and enlarged, thus making it applicable to
    other states.</p>
    <p>At Auburn two receptions were given the convention&mdash;one by the Young Men's
    Christian Association, and one in the historic home of William H. Seward.</p>
    <p>In Elmira the convention was invited to visit the art gallery of Mr. M.H.
    Arnot.</p>
    <p>While the twenty-first annual convention does not properly belong to a
    twenty-years history, still we feel it is fitting to mention here that we celebrated
    our majority by "going home" to Chautauqua county, the meeting being held at
    Jamestown; and while it is not the intention to report that meeting here, we desire
    to record the fact that, by vote of this convention, New York State claims as its own
    the honor of the first crusade, and of the first Woman's Christian Temperance Union
    ever organized. Never have we been more royally entertained than in Jamestown. The
    Woman's and Young Woman's Christian Associations, the Political Equality Club, and
    the Woman's Relief Corps gave us an elegant reception the first day, and on the day
    following the close of the convention, through the generosity of the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> local Woman's
    Christian Temperance Union, we were taken up the lake on a steamer to the far-famed
    Chautauqua Assembly grounds, the place from which was issued the "crusade call" to
    the women of the country to convene at Cleveland, Ohio, in November, 1874.</p>
    <h4>NATIONAL BANNERS.</h4>
    <p>In 1887 New York State received, through the president, a handsome banner
    presented by the national union at Nashville as a reward for the largest membership
    of any state in the Union, and in 1890 we received the beautiful prize banner awarded
    by Miss Willard at Atlanta to the state making the largest increase in membership,
    New York being first in the Middle States. At the Denver convention, in 1892, New
    York was again awarded the national prize banner for the largest percentage of
    increase in membership.</p>
    <p>In 1893 our state received two other national banners&mdash;one from Miss Lucia F.
    Kimball, national superintendent of Sunday-school Work, for returning the largest
    number of signed autograph pledge cards for the World's Fair, and the other from Mrs.
    Mary H. Hunt, national superintendent of the Department of Scientific Temperance
    Instruction, for having the largest number of local superintendents of this
    department of any State in the Union.</p>
    <h4>STATE BANNERS.</h4>
    <p>In 1889 Mrs. Ella C. Viele, publisher of our state paper, <i>Woman's Temperance
    Work</i>, presented a banner to the county having the largest subscription list from
    January to September. Dutchess county captured the prize, holding it until 1892, when
    Steuben received it; but in 1893 Dutchess county came to the front and again claimed
    it for its own.</p>
    <h4>PRESIDENT'S PRIZE BANNERS.</h4>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
    <p>Through the generosity of our president, the state has five banners which are
    awarded each year to the counties showing the greatest increase in membership. The
    state is divided into four tiers&mdash;northern, southern, eastern, and
    western&mdash;and a banner goes to the county in each division which has rolled up
    the greatest increase. The fifth banner is for the Y's, and is awarded to the county
    which has gained most in Y. membership, regardless of location.</p>
    <p>The Loyal Temperance Legion also has a beautiful banner, which was first presented
    in 1891 to Suffolk county for having gained most in the number of Loyal Temperance
    Legions during the year.</p>
    <p>These banners are each held for one year, being then brought to the annual meeting
    and "passed along" or held over again, as the case may be.</p>
    <h4>EXHIBITS.</h4>
    <p>In 1885 our state was represented at the World's Exposition at New Orleans by a
    beautiful banner, and that we were worthily represented is shown by the fact that to
    this banner was awarded the first honorable mention.</p>
    <p>The exhibit sent by our state to the Columbian Exposition, and which was placed in
    the Woman's Christian Temperance Union exhibit, was a beautiful banner, five feet
    wide by seven feet in length, of dark blue silk, telling in large gilt letters the
    name of our organization, with legend of our membership, W. and Y., and honorary
    members; also the number of members of the Loyal Temperance Legion, the location of
    headquarters, and name of state paper. It also gave the laws which have been secured
    through the state's instrumentality. A sketch of the state work was also prepared for
    the historical work published<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
    82]</a></span> by the Chicago World Book Company, and for the encyclopaedia published
    by the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Commission.</p>
    <h4>SUMMER MEETINGS.</h4>
    <p>In 1883 our state for the first time held summer meetings&mdash;one at Thousand
    Island Park and one at Round Lake, both being well attended.</p>
    <p>In April, 1884, a conference under state auspices was held in the Broadway
    Tabernacle, New York City. At this meeting Hannah Whithall Smith gave a Bible reading
    in the afternoon, and Frances E. Willard an address in the evening, to large
    audiences. In July of this same year a grove meeting was held at Round Lake, and in
    August the state, with Wyoming county, occupied a day at Silver Lake.</p>
    <p>On August 9 and 10 in 1887 a meeting was held at Sacandaga Park, in Fulton
    county.</p>
    <p>In May, 1889, the state held a conference of two days in the lecture hall of the
    Young Men's Christian Association building, New York City, and a school of methods
    held at Griffin Institute, Round Lake, August 7 to 9, was a success in every way. In
    July a two-days' conference was held at Prohibition Park, Staten Island.</p>
    <p>In July of 1890 a three-days' meeting was held at Round Lake, and in the summer of
    1891 a meeting was again held at Prohibition Park&mdash;these meetings all being
    under state auspices.</p>
    <p>In the fall of 1888 the state had the honor of entertaining the national
    convention, although most of the responsibility, financial and otherwise, rested upon
    New York City and the neighboring counties. Right royally was this convention
    entertained. The Metropolitan Opera House was secured for the meetings at a cost of
    $2,500 for the five days. Nearly $900 was paid to the caterer,<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> and $200 more for
    the privilege of serving lunch, beside incidental expenses. Mrs. Burt and her corps
    of assistants did heroic work in the planning and carrying forward to a successful
    finish the arrangements for the entertainment of this great gathering.</p>
    <p>This chapter would hardly be complete if we failed to mention the beautiful
    welcome which our state extended to our national president, Frances E. Willard, on
    her return from England after an absence of nearly two years. This meeting was held
    in Calvary Baptist Church, on West Fifty-seventh street, New York City, and when we
    say that the arrangements were all in the hands of Mrs. Mary T. Burt and Mrs. Frances
    J. Barnes, that is sufficient guarantee that they were perfect. Mrs. Burt presided
    over the meeting. Mrs. Boole and Mrs. Tenney of the state officers were present,
    beside many from other states. The "Greeting" was beautifully illuminated and
    engrossed upon parchment, and framed in white and gold. In the upper left-hand
    corner, delicately done in water colors, was the graceful figure of a woman twining
    the white ribbon around the world. Greetings came from all directions&mdash;by word,
    by letter, and by telegram&mdash;and everything conspired to make this one of the
    most delightful gatherings ever held under state auspices.</p>
    <p>In 1893 the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of the State of New York received a
    legacy of $2,000 from Mrs. Helen S. Houghtaling, of New York City, who, although not
    a member of our organization, became interested in our work through her niece, Miss
    Evelena Brandow, president of Greene County Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and
    through reading our state paper, she being a regular subscriber to the same.</p>
